## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
i learnt how to apply more than one googlefonts to a HTML document and also understand how to manipulate border-radius in styling HTML elements.

```css
..sedan {
 border-radius: 0.5rem 0 0 0.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development
While learning, I came across a tutorial where a button can be used as a link instead of creating <div> and <a>.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for understanding Semantic HTML markup and CSS custom properties . I really liked the website, useful resources and beginner friendly.
